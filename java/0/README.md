# Lesson 0
Welcome to learning code the hard(er) way, Java edition!
Inspired by Zed Shaw's [Learn Code the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/), I am motivated to create a tutorial with a similar tone (also, there is no Java lesson yet).

## Motivation
One of the first (programming) languages I learned was Java. But years later, I became engrossed in serveral other languages (C, C++, C# [load of c], Python, JavaScript [still trying to square that one away]) as well as some other useful syntaxes (syntacies? syntaxen?) like SQL, Regex, HTML, CSS, shell (primarily bash).

When I wanted to re-learn (or prime as the kids say these days) Java, I looked up a quick tutorials. But I noticed the _same_ approach I learned with _every_ language. So I decided to switch up the approach with a method-first style (if you don't know what a method is, keep reading and you'll be an expert soon-ish).

## Audience
In this first draft, I'm creating this tutorial for my own sake. So if there's a lot of technobable it's because I'm using terminology and jargon from when I learned it the first time. I'll try to explain whenever I can to the best of my ability, but if it still sounds like another language ([que rimshot](https://youtu.be/oShTJ90fC34)) call me out on it!

## Getting ready
Before we start programming, we need to make sure you are set up for success. You will need _at least_ these things:
1. a computer
1. a text editor
1. The [Java Software Development Kit (JDK for short)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * Or if you are into open-source software: [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/)
If you have the first item, you most likely have the second item (although it can be pretty simple and lack a ton of features).
The last item requires a little more instruction on installing. Also the instructions vary _wildly_ by operating system (the software that makes you computer more than a fancy, plastic paperweight).

// TODO instructions to install JDK

## Making sure it works
To test your Java compiler works, create a new file and insert this into it:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ShooShoSha/e736746be56d04e604afbe288bd7403d.js"></script>

If it does't explode, congratulations! **Now** we can start Java programming!
